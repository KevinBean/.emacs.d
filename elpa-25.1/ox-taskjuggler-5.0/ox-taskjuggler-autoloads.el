(autoload 'org-taskjuggler-export "ox-taskjuggler" "\
Export current buffer to a TaskJuggler file.

The exporter looks for a tree with tag that matches
`org-taskjuggler-project-tag' and takes this as the tasks for
this project.  The first node of this tree defines the project
properties such as project name and project period.

If there is a tree with tag that matches
`org-taskjuggler-resource-tag' this tree is taken as resources
for the project.  If no resources are specified, a default
resource is created and allocated to the project.

Also the TaskJuggler project will be created with default reports
as defined in `org-taskjuggler-default-reports'.

If narrowing is active in the current buffer, only export its
narrowed part.

If a region is active, export that region.

A non-nil optional argument ASYNC means the process should happen
asynchronously.  The resulting file should be accessible through
the `org-export-stack' interface.

When optional argument SUBTREEP is non-nil, export the sub-tree
at point, extracting information from the headline properties
first.

When optional argument VISIBLE-ONLY is non-nil, don't export
contents of hidden elements.

Return output file's name.

Export and process the file using

reports with a browser.

If you are targeting TaskJuggler 2.4 (see
`org-taskjuggler-target-version') the processing and display of
the reports is done using the TaskJuggler GUI.
