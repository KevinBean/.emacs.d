(autoload 'org-capture-string "org-capture" "\

This will let you select a template from `org-capture-templates', and
then file the newly captured information.  The text is immediately
inserted at the target location, and an indirect buffer is shown where
you can edit it.  Pressing `\\[org-capture-finalize]' brings you back to the previous
state of Emacs, so that you can continue your work.

When called interactively with a `\\[universal-argument]' prefix argument GOTO, don't
capture anything, just go to the file/headline where the selected
template stores its notes.

With a `\\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]' prefix argument, go to the last note stored.

When called with a `C-0' (zero) prefix, insert a template at point.

ELisp programs can set KEYS to a string associated with a template
in `org-capture-templates'.  In this case, interactive selection
will be bypassed.

If `org-capture-use-agenda-date' is non-nil, capturing from the
agenda will use the date at point as the default date.  Then, a
`C-1' prefix will tell the capture process to use the HH:MM time
of the day at point (if any) or the current HH:MM time.
